Ronald Reagan &amp; @realDonaldTrump are different men w/ different styles, but are fundamentally similar in their honesty, toughness &amp; optimism
.@realDonaldTrump will nominate justices to the Supreme Court in the mold of the late Justice Antonin Scalia
This election is not just about the next 4 years. It will determine the future of the Supreme Court for the next 40 years @ronaldreagan40
On his 1st day in office @realDonaldTrump will repeal every job-killing executive order burdening our job creators @ronaldreagan40
.@realDonaldTrump believes in the strength &amp; ingenuity of the American people &amp; will unleash the boundless potential of our economy
There are more than 7 million Americans living in poverty today than when @BarackObama took office
The foreign policy record of this administration and @HillaryClinton has made America weaker. @realDonaldTrump knows weakness arouses evil
Like Ronald Reagan, @realDonaldTrump knows that in order to have peace, America needs to be strong
Our choice has never been more clear. We can either elect my running mate, a bold truth-teller, or the most dishonest candidate in history
Like Ronald Reagan, @realDonaldTrump has the toughness to rebuild our economy and command the respect of the world @ronaldreagan40
And the same belief in the greatness of this country and the same confidence in the boundless potential of the American people (2/2)
At the heart of Donald's Trump's campaign is the same impatience - the same dissatisfaction with the status quo (1/2)
Like Ronald Reagan, Donald Trump has the honesty/bluntness to confront the challenges facing the American people from his 1st day in office
Ronald Reagan's example informed my entire political life and it forms it still to this day @ronaldreagan40
I want to talk to you today about 2 men. One, who has inspired me my entire life &amp; one who has become my good friend @ronaldreagan40

There's a word that comes to mind when you think of @HillaryClinton deleting nearly 18k emails-'obstruction'
.@realDonaldTrump will rebuild our military, stand by allies, stand up to enemies, &amp; will command respect Americans deserve &amp; world needs
That's why today 88 generals &amp; admirals endorsed @realDonaldTrump as our next Commander in Chief
It's been amateur hour on the world stage for the last 7 1/2 years and America, our allies and those who defend our freedom know it
Despite traveling millions of miles as SOS, the world is more dangerous today than the day @BarackObama &amp; @HillaryClinton took office
It's time to set the record straight. The leadership of @BarackObama &amp; @HillaryClinton has weakened America's place in the world

RT @indgop: "Unemployment in the last 4 years has dropped from 8% to 5%." -Gov. Pence @GovPenceIN
The best days for the best state in the nation are yet to come. Let's go get it!
This is not a choice between two candidates, or two parties - it's a choice between two futures.
We can find more effective &amp; compassionate treatment for those who are caught up in the scourge of drug abuse in Indiana.
We can finally find a test other than ISTEP that both parents and teachers can believe in.
&amp; I'm just getting started.
Anyone who knows the Pences knows we're all about family.
John Gregg called Obamacare "good news" and a "game-changer."
My opponent's record is very different.
When I became Governor I had a goal: have more Hoosiers going to work than ever before. Now, a record amount of Hoosiers are going to work!
Record investment from companies large and small, and IN was rated in the top 5 states in America to do business.
We've invested billions in the Crossroads of America, and were still able to pass the largest tax cut in Indiana history.
Now, we've balanced budgets, maintained strong reserves, and made historic investments in education.
We're going to make sure every Hoosier knows John Gregg's record before election day. A record of deficits, debt, and higher taxes.

From the outset of my administration, we maintained fiscal discipline, balanced 2 budgets, &amp; made the largest state tax cut in IN HISTORY.
When I became Governor three years ago, I knew we could go from reform to results.
