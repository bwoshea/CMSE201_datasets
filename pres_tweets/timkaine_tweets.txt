Trump keeps whining to the moderators about how much time he's getting on his answers. Thin skin!
Donald says Russia and Syria are killing ISIS? They're killing Syrian citizens. And he acts like they are fighting terrorists? Get real.

The obligation for communities to affirmatively further #FairHousing is not new. RT if you stand against attempts to weaken the AFFH rule

AFFH rule is at the core of #FairHousing Act. It's about expanding opportunity, investing in communities, and giving people choice

As @POTUS noted, the scourge of opioid addiction cuts across party lines. Let's come together to lift up communities hurt by this epidemic
Appreciate @POTUS's call for an #AUMF. Congress cannot let another year go by without debating &amp; authorizing the war vs ISIL #SOTU
Tonight, @POTUS reflected on the significant progress our country has made over the past seven years and challenged us to reach higher #SOTU
Hoping to hear how @POTUS plans to build on his efforts to address the opioid epidemic this year
According to the @CDCgov, opioid overdose deaths hit record levels in 2014 ,killing more than 47,000 people
Honored to welcome Don as my #SOTU guest &amp; I’m hopeful that we can raise awareness of the opioid epidemic and take action to stop it
My guest for the #SOTU is Don Flattery of Alexandria, a member of VA's drug abuse task force &amp; powerful advocate https://t.co/27v8SQr0lc

Agree w/@HillaryClinton. We can move towards preventing &amp; treating Alzheimer's by 2025 if we increase research funding &amp; improve caregiving
Hopeful that passage of the #OmnibusBill will inspire more bipartisan cooperation in the new year!
#OmnibusBill has funding for a FASTC at Fort Pickett, which is recognition of the need to provide diplomatic personnel security training

Congress needs to finally debate &amp; vote on an #AUMF. It shows our allies, troops &amp; the public that we are unified in resolve against ISIL
The events of recent weeks demonstrate that Congress can no longer ignore ISIL threat and its constitutional duty to authorize war
House and Senate leaders should move consideration of an ISIL-specific #AUMF to the top of the legislative agenda
As @POTUS stated, an #AUMF would demonstrate the American people are united and committed to the fight against ISIL

You can watch my speech from the floor of the Senate following the #IranDeal vote here: https://t.co/aeLveb9yaW
@AndyjudxUSA I addressed this more in detail on the floor after the vote https://t.co/aeLveb9yaW
GOP unwillingness to allow an up or down vote on the #IranDeal with a 60 vote threshold - as agreed to - is unfortunate &amp; disappointing
I voted in support of the #IranDeal today. This deal honors the best traditions of American diplomacy &amp; makes the world safer
Tomorrow is more important than yesterday. The #IranDeal puts the U.S. &amp; world in a better position than the status quo with Iran
I believe using diplomacy before military force is fundamentally part of our American values &amp; creates a more peaceful world #IranDeal
Just as a strong military enhances diplomacy, strong diplomacy enhances our military might #IranDeal

The #IranDeal is not about making an ally out of an adversary. It is about denying an adversary a path to obtaining nuclear weapons
The #IranDeal takes a nuclear weapons program that was progressing forward and disables it for many years through peaceful diplomatic means
On the #IranDeal, America has shown that patient diplomacy can achieve what isolation &amp; hostility cannot. For this reason, I will support it

Giving negotiators time to make sure they get the best deal possible with #Iran is better than walking away from progress that’s been made
So many @PPFA advocates here on the Hill today! Thank you for supporting the #TeachSafe Relationships Act
Secondary schools should play a role in promoting safe relationship behavior. It can make our country safer #TeachSafe #ESEA
#TeachSafe Relationships provision in #EveryChildAchieves bill would place a higher emphasis on discussions about safe relationship behavior

Our economy &amp; quality of life depends on robust transportation investments. A short term patch kicks the can down our bumpy, unpaved roads
FACT: Nearly 1 in 4 bridges in the U.S. are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete http://t.co/p3VRS2dJHJ
Renew the Highway Trust Fund, pass a long-term transportation bill. Our roads need it http://t.co/JC6D4Oe6Dl
4,800 VA bridges need the investments of a long-term transportation &amp; infrastructure bill, not the uncertainty of a short-term patch
On my way to SASC hearing to talk steps forward in fight vs ISIL. My thoughts? Let's pass an #AUMF to define mission &amp; support our troops
About to be on the air with @jfradioshow to talk #AUMF &amp; trade. Listen live: http://t.co/MrMThbmXgP

Let's not let sea level rise affect our defense readiness- we should give DoD the tools to withstand impacts of #climatechange #ActOnClimate
Studies show rate of sea level rise is accelerating. This poses serious challenges for Hampton Roads #ActOnClimate http://t.co/2ef1dKSPWS
.@POTUS is right. Effects of #climatechange jeopardize national security preparedness, particularly at Naval Station Norfolk #ActOnClimate
Ending the travel ban to #Cuba will encourage the free exchange of ideas &amp; values, including respect for human rights. It is time.
Headed to a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on path forward for relations between the US &amp; Cuba

I challenge my colleagues to demonstrate same courage by passing an #AUMF against ISIL
