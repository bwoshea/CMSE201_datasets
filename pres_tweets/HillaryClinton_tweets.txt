Trump on equal pay: "Do as good a job" as men.

Abortion? Should be "punished."

Pregnancy? An "inconvenience."

Wives working? "Dangerous."
We've heard Donald's insults for years, and his policies reflect this disregard—even contempt—for women.
Trump obsessively bullies Rosie O'Donnell—an accomplished actor. He insulted Kim Kardashian for her weight—when she was pregnant. Pathetic.

What Trump should do: for once in his life, own up to his mistakes. Apologize to the President, and to the American people.
Trump’s birtherism stems from the same innate beliefs that led to discriminating against black tenants early in his career. Can't be undone.
The birther lie is what turned Trump from an ordinary reality TV star into a political figure. That origin story can't be unwritten.
Trump has spent years peddling a racist conspiracy aimed at undermining the first African American president. He can't just take it back.
This shouldn't have to be said: You don’t just get to say someone else did the worst things you’ve done. It doesn’t work. No one buys it.

Donald Trump is unfit to be president.
We just can’t accept this.
We’ve got to stand up to this.
If we don’t, it won’t stop.
Barack Obama was born in America, plain and simple.

Donald Trump owes him and the American people an apology.
Just yesterday, Trump again refused to say with his own words that the president was born in the United States.
"We know who Donald is. For five years, he has led the birther movement to de-legitimize our first black president.” —Hillary

Trump is running the most divisive campaign of our lifetimes.

There’s no innuendo or dog whistles anymore. It’s all out in the open now.
Donald Trump still refuses to say @POTUS was born in America. And this man wants to be our president?

When will he stop this ugliness?
America is one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Not just for people who look or worship a certain way.
Despite what Donald Trump may say, immigrants are not rapists and criminals.
No child should have to say goodbye to their parents every morning not knowing if mom or dad will be there when they get home.
"We have a chance to show that comprehensive immigration reform isn’t just the smart thing to do—it’s what the American people demand."
Supporting families with paid family leave, earned sick days, and affordable child care isn’t a luxury—it’s a necessity.
It's wrong when Latinos are 17% of our population and hold only 2% of its wealth.

We've got to connect more Latinos with good jobs.

20. It's pretty clear: Trump's spent his life unscrupulously looking out for his own wallet above all. Why would that change as president?
19. In sum, how will Trump guarantee that if forced to choose between America's security and his own bank account, he won't pick the latter?
18. We'll let @kurteichenwald ask this one: https://t.co/xnIl6JazS3
17. Will your children disclose all of the foreign trips and business deals they've undertaken during the campaign, and with whom they met?
16. You've mentioned ~120 foreign deals, including in countries with national security implications. Where and with whom are you working?
15. To what extent are you and your family currently contractually tied to payments from foreign business partners, or governments?
14. We know you engaged extensively in pay-to-play here at home. Have you bribed foreign officials or other parties abroad?
13. How can we know you won't (again) impulsively damage relationships with crucial allies to preserve your own ego? https://t.co/j1VtaFhA6C
12. How can we be sure you'd be willing to be tough on any nation if necessary, if it would put your interests and profits at risk?
11. With business ties to politically-connected Indian developers, how can you conduct foreign policy that puts the U.S. above your profits?
10. How did the Russian mob boss who ran a criminal organization out of Trump Tower get a VIP pass to your Miss Universe pageant in Moscow?
9. Have you or your campaign discussed U.S.-Russian relations with the Russian billionaires with whom you've done business?
8. Will you disclose the nature of your personal and business relationships with all of the Russian oligarchs you are “close” to?
7. To what extent would your foreign policy be dictated by potential financial benefits for your business partners? https://t.co/4Nd9KSdTfi
6. Given that you've already questioned our commitments to NATO allies, what is your answer to this? https://t.co/qp5vMqtcs1
5. How can you be tough on Iran, given your business partnership with someone connected to Iranian money laundering? https://t.co/1AdDm2kfvy
4. If you were willing to work with Qaddafi—a known terrorist and dictator—is there anyone you aren't willing to make a deal with? Who?
3. While refusing to release your tax returns, how will you confirm that you do not have dangerous financial ties to bad actors abroad?
2. How will you handle non-cancelable contractual obligations with parties whose interests conflict with those of the United States?
1. Will you sever ties with your company linked to foreign leaders, questionable organizations, and criminals if you become president?

Our rising generation of young Americans is the most open, diverse, and connected we’ve ever seen.
"Every day, more Americans are standing up and saying 'enough is enough'—including a lot of Republicans. I’m honored to have their support."
In 2008, John McCain told his own supporters that Barack Obama is an American citizen and "a decent person."
The week after 9/11, George W. Bush went to a mosque and declared for everyone to hear that Muslims 'love America just as much as I do.'
20 years ago, when Bob Dole accepted the Republican nomination, he pointed to the exits and told any racists in the Party to get out.
There’s an old Mexican proverb that says “Tell me with whom you walk, and I will tell you who you are.”

Strengthening unions doesn’t just serve their members—it leads to better pay, benefits, and working conditions for all employees.
Trump wants to give trillions in tax breaks to people like himself.

Instead, let’s invest in our veterans, kids, schools and police.
The 400 richest taxpayers in America would get an average tax cut of more than $15 million a year from the Trump loophole.
Trump wants to eliminate the estate tax. What that would mean: his family gets a $4 billion tax cut. 99.8% of Americans get nothing.
